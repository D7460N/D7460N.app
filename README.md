# üß† D7460N Copilot Context

This repository contains the **canonical shared context** file for GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, used across all D7460N-based projects.

## ‚úÖ Purpose

The file [`copilot-context.md`](./copilot-context.md) defines strict architectural and behavioral rules for Copilot to follow, ensuring:

- Consistent recommendations across environments
- Enforcement of D7460N project standards
- No framework dependencies
- Accessible, semantic, and declarative UI logic

## üåê How to Use It

In any GitHub Copilot Chat-enabled project (VS Code, desktop or vscode.dev):

1. Download or sync the file:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://copilot.d7460n.app/copilot-context.md -o copilot-context.md
   ```

2. In Copilot Chat, type:
   ```
   /remember copilot-context.md
   ```

This will load the canonical project rules into Copilot‚Äôs working memory.
